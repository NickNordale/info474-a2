        <h3>Tool Description</h3>
        <p>
            <b>For your visual layout, describe why it is an optimal choice for expressing your data
                effectively (~ 1 paragraph).</b>

                This tool serves two primary functions: it provides means to analyze the differences in statistical
                measures between teams and groups of teams, and also this tool can be used to analyze the
                statistical characteristics of good teams and bad teams. I chose a scatterplot for the visualization
                because scatterplots are a great tool to use in making comparisons and assessing relationships
                between variables. Humans are most capable of judging position against a common scale, which is
                exactly what a scatterplot provides. Also, scatterplots can facilitate interactive functionality in a
                way that is not visually overwhelming or confusing because it is a 2D plane and the axes positions
                remain constant.

            <b>Then, for each controlling element, detail how it enables your user to ask different
                questions (~1 paragraph).</b>

            <br>
            <span>
                I included two groups of controlling elements in this tool. One to toggle the conference of the NBA
                teams, and one to control which statistical metrics were displayed along the y-axis. The conference
                control, allows the user to analyze differences across either the whole population of teams, or
                differences across conferences. I added this because, for several years now, the Western Conference
                has widely been believed to be the superior conference. This control could lead to insights on
                why this discrepancy exists. The statistical metric control, allows the user to explore the relationships
                between various stats and winning percentage. More explicitly, the user could try and determine
                which stats are more likely to indicate a good team, and which stats might correlate strongly with
                losing teams/low win percentage.

            <b>You should include specific examples of insights you discovered through the use of these tools.</b>

            <br>
            <span>
                I discovered something interesting in the shooting percentage metrics (FG%, 3P%, FT%). It is intuitive
                that the teams who shoot better, would likely win more games. Such appears to be the case for FG% and
                3P%, however, there seems to be virtually no correlation between FT% and WIN%. This is interesting both
                because you would expect better free throw shooting teams to win more because they earn more points when
                fouled, but this is also curious because it means that the winningest teams who are shooting high percentages
                from the field and from behind the three point line, are, relatively, shooting poorly at the line.
                <br>
                Also, in comparing the conferences, I noticed that the Eastern Conference points were bunched more closely
                together than the Western Conferences points for most of the metrics. This led to my hypothesis that,
                maybe the Eastern Conference contains teams which are somewhat similar to each other in style and makeup,
                whereas the Western Conference has a more diverse group of teams. This would take further analysis, but
                I could imagine that Eastern Conference teams could potentially have a harder time against each other
                because of how similar each team is to each other. This similarity and familiarity of style could
                decrease the variance of those matchups - ultimately normalizing the winning percentages of the top
                teams in that conference.
